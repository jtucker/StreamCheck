StreamCheck
===

Simple F# script that will query against [Can I Stream It](http://canistream.it) for a provided movie name. It only takes the first item from the result set and queries for the streaming services for that movie. So you are at the whim of Can I Stream It's search engine. 

Getting Started
---

 * Clone the site
 * run `.paket/paket.boostrapper.exe`
 * run `.paket/paket install`

You will then have all the necessary items needed for the script to run. Just fire it up in F# Interactive.
